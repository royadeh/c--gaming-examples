## Overview

`cpp-gaming-examples` offers a series of simple and interactive **C++** code samples that cover different aspects of game development. These examples are intended to help learners and enthusiasts practice and understand the concepts of game logic, randomization, player interactions, and more.

## Features

- **Various Game Types**: Examples cover a wide range of gameplay, such as board games, dice rolling games, and trap activation mechanics.
- **Randomization**: Demonstrates how to implement random events and decisions using the C++ `rand()` function and `time()` for seeding.
- **Game Loops**: Shows how to implement the main game loop for continuous play and turn-taking.
- **Trap Activation & Simulation**: Simulates real-time game mechanics such as trap failures and cheese collection.
- **Player Interactions**: Basic input handling for interactive gameplay.
